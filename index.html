        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our product idea initially came from our experiences with our exchange student Minsu and my own experiences of learning Japanese and Korean. In languages like Japanese and Chinese, there are thousands of symbols that are necessary to memorize to have a decent understanding of the language and to be able to read it when you go down the streets. Although there are many learning resources available, it’s nearly impossible to use your phone to translate every symbol you come across when in a foreign country, making it easy for you to get lost. Additionally, cultural nuances are almost impossible to pick up on with traditional translation methods, which is why my exchange student had such a hard time adapting to the United States. He would have seriously benefitted from a real-time translation device to take some of the pressure off of being an exchange student (an already stressful experience).</p>

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>Getting lost in translation is frustrating. Pulling out your phone every few seconds just to understand a street sign or a menu? Even worse. That’s why we created AR translation glasses that instantly convert foreign symbols into your native language—no scanning, no interruptions, just seamless understanding. And because communication isn’t just about reading, our built-in projection feature lets you trace foreign characters onto paper, making writing in a new language just as effortless. Whether you're traveling, studying abroad, or just exploring new cultures, our goal is simple: break down language barriers so you can focus on the experience, not the translation.</p>
